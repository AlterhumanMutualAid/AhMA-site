# AhMA-site
Repo for the Mutual Aid site

# **Site hosting:**

Useful looking site with info similar to what I’m hoping to compile: [Kalechips Hosting](https://kalechips.net/stuff/hosting)

## Ranking system:

Price (including domain name and safety plan for certain “free” options since its basically mandatory)  
Coding requirement  
Safety (Data safety/Privacy)

- Where are things stored and how safe is that  
- Do they have built in redundancy for information safety  
- Who owns your info at the end of the day  
- Are there built in safeguards against plagiarization and ai info theft

Performance (Scope/storage)  
Reliability (Uptime/support)

- Geolocated servers

Morality check (Who runs it/GenAi usage)

## Some options:

### *Paid:*

GoDaddy  
Ionos  
Bluehost  
HostGator  
SquareSpace  
Network Solutions  
SiteGround  
DreamHost  
Verpex  
HostArmada  
Wordpress.**com**  
Google sites  
Nearly Free Speech (Actually looks pretty affordable for a paid option)  
Ghost (their main site was hard to find so I’m linking it [here](https://ghost.org/))

### *Technically free but caveat:*

\~ Major caveat  
Wix (you need your own domain name first or pay them for one after a free trial)  
Weebly (heavy private small business marketplace focus, doesn’t seem to have many tools outside that)  
Webflow (You get 2 static pages and 50 cms items \<blog posts\> for free, after that it’s paid)  
Carrd (You only get *1* static page with this one)  
\~ Minor caveat  
InfinityFree (Adds on the main site are atrocious, I don’t think it auto adds them to your site, if it does this goes in major caveat)  
Github pages (Free, but only if you are basing your page on a public repository, could be considered a positive in some situations)  
Leprd (Limited site enrollment to prevent overwhelming the private hosting service, otherwise looks like a great option tho)  
Strawpage (Bright colors and hard to understand and I can’t tell how robust and tool rich it is without going through the whole process of making one, but seems to be free, and the drag and drop builder tool works on mobile)

### *Other free options:*

Gitlab pages  
Neocities  
Web 1.0 Hosting  
Teacake  
Bearblog

# **SSGs:**

SSG stands for Static Site Generator  
[This site](https://jamstack.org/generators/) lists a *ton* of static site generators and a small blurb about all of them  
[This site](https://github.com/myles/awesome-static-generators) does something similar

For the example website we are using:  
Publii

Also, I want to specifically highlight:  
Quartz (SSG designed specifically to work with and complement Obsidian notes app)  
\<Because I personally use obsidian and saw interest in an ssg for Obsidian in otherconnect\>

You can also use prewritten code from various sites and copy paste it over and edit as desired, we’re not going to go over that much, you can find more about it in Daski’s panel earlier this othercon

# **Multi-editor stuff:**

# **Other stuff:**

I need to add a section specifically for making resources that multiple people can edit together  
[https://bitbucket.org/product/](https://bitbucket.org/product/)

Netlab might need another check when my brain is functioning better, seems to be a resource for home network setup for private site hosting from home

There are two wordpresses they work together in tandem but wordpress.**COM** is the web hosting service and wordpress.**ORG** is the ssg

If you know someone, and/or are already getting a ton of help from someone who knows how to program, consider formally commissioning them for their time.

Make it exist first, then make it look cool and customize

Codeberg \- Still can’t figure out what this is

# **Coding resources:**

Not necessarily relevant to the panel, but might make a page on the example site for it
